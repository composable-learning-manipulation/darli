- State Space
  - [ ] The proper Jacobians with quaternions in the state (tangent )
  - [ ] The discrete state space (integrator)
  - [ ] Implement Hamiltonian State Space i.e `state = [position, momentum]`
- Modeling Backends
  - [ ] Refactor the model class, add folder with backends
  - [ ] Implement or use some ready implementation `rnea, crba, regressor, forward_kinematics` with JAX or PyTorch 
  - [ ] Pure pinocchio backend and 'all-in-one' update  
- Constrained and Contact Dynamics
  - [ ] Features to create closed loops with holonomic/nonholonomic constraints (Lagrangian/Udwadia-Kalaba)
  - [ ] The minimal coordinates representation
- Parametric Model 
  - [ ] Physical consistancy constraints and conversion to pseudo inertia (4x4) matrix and back.
  - [ ] Implement all dynamical attributes with auxilary `parameter` input
  - [ ] `Regressors` class
- General:
  - [ ] Add number of bodies `nv` and their names to model attributes.  
  - [ ] Configuration difference functions
  - [ ] Code generation and just in time compilation
  - [ ] Prepare docs and proper examples for each aspect of the library
  - [ ] Friction and Joint inertias for active joints
  - [ ] Effort/velocity limits from urdf
- Refactoring 
  - [ ] Do the following...
